Hello!

This tool will help you audit the Adobe licenses. 

Quickstart:

1. Download csv files of all adobe users from SoFi.
2. export the xlsx file of all active employees to csv.
3. Rename the csv file containing all SoFi employees so that it no longer has spaces. This is good practice in general.
3. open a terminal window, navigate to this folder, and run "python3 adobeaudit.py".
4. double check users that are returned before removing their licenses.
